# topic_modeling

Data: ~21,000 progress notes were extracted from a database of patient records if they contained one or more of the following terms:

* htn
* hypertension
* systolic
* diastolic
* bp

The goal was to use bag-of-words text mining (using the tidytext package) and topic modeling (using the topicmodels package) to perform exploratory analyses of this unstructured data.

See [html report](https://github.com/lopierra/topic_modeling/blob/master/topic_modeling_public.html) for results.
